# RFC-092: Test Full Automation Flow

## Summary
Test RFC to validate the complete end-to-end automation flow from issue creation through PR merge and issue closure.

## Implementation Plan (Micro Issues)

### RFC-092-01: Validate Issue Assignment
Test that the rfc-assign-cron workflow correctly assigns issues to Copilot within 10 minutes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Issue created via rfc-sync
- [ ] Issue assigned to Copilot bot
- [ ] Assignment happens automatically within 10 minutes

### RFC-092-02: Validate PR Creation
Test that Copilot automatically creates a PR when assigned to an issue.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] PR created automatically by copilot-swe-agent
- [ ] PR title contains RFC identifier
- [ ] PR body contains "Closes #<issue-number>"

### RFC-092-03: Validate CI and Auto-Ready
Test that CI runs successfully and PR is marked ready automatically.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] CI workflow runs and passes
- [ ] auto-ready-pr workflow marks PR as ready
- [ ] Enhanced CI validation prevents false successes

## Testing Flow

The expected end-to-end flow:
1. RFC pushed â†’ rfc-sync creates micro issues
2. rfc-assign-cron assigns first issue to Copilot
3. Copilot creates PR automatically
4. CI runs and passes
5. auto-ready-pr marks PR ready
6. auto-approve-merge approves PR
7. PR auto-merges
8. Issue closes automatically
9. auto-advance-micro assigns next issue

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete automation flow works without manual intervention
- [ ] All micro issues are processed sequentially
- [ ] No stuck PRs or orphaned issues
- [ ] Enhanced CI validation working correctly
