# Flow-RFC-001: 2-Layer Notion RFC Architecture

- **Start Date**: 2025-09-18
- **RFC Author**: Claude
- **Status**: Draft
- **Type**: Flow/Automation Enhancement

## Summary

This RFC defines a 2-layer RFC architecture in Notion to bridge the gap between high-level architectural documentation and implementable micro-issues. The system maintains design integrity while enabling automated GitHub issue generation for coding agents.

## Motivation

Current challenges with RFC → micro-issue automation:

1. **Architectural RFCs are too high-level** for direct micro-issue generation
2. **Missing implementation guidance** between design and code
3. **Manual transformation required** from concepts to tasks
4. **No systematic approach** to breaking down architectural patterns
5. **Inconsistent micro-issue quality** due to lack of structure

## Detailed Design

### Layer 1: Architectural RFCs (Current)
**Purpose**: Design documentation, patterns, system architecture
**Audience**: Architects, senior developers, system designers
**Content**: High-level concepts, motivation, trade-offs, design patterns

**Example Structure**:
```markdown
# RFC-001: GameConsole 4-Tier Service Architecture
## Summary
## Motivation
## Detailed Design
### Architecture Scope
### Service Tier Classification
## Benefits & Drawbacks
```

### Layer 2: Implementation RFCs (New)
**Purpose**: Implementation-ready task breakdown
**Audience**: GitHub Copilot, coding agents, individual contributors
**Content**: Specific tasks, acceptance criteria, code examples

**Required Structure**:
```markdown
# Game-RFC-001: 4-Tier Implementation

### Game-RFC-001-01: Create Tier 1 Base Interfaces
**Objective**: Implement foundational service interface contracts
**Requirements**:
- Create GameConsole.Core.Abstractions project
- Define IService base interface
- Add ICapabilityProvider interface
- Include XML documentation

**Implementation Details**:
- Target framework: net8.0
- Namespace: GameConsole.Services
- Use CancellationToken for all async methods
- Follow Pure.DI compatibility patterns

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] IService interface compiles without external dependencies
- [ ] All methods have proper async signatures with CancellationToken
- [ ] Code passes lint validation (dotnet format --verify-no-changes)
- [ ] Unit tests cover interface contracts
- [ ] XML documentation coverage > 90%
```

📁 RFC Collection
├── 📁 Architecture

    └── [... implementation RFCs ...]
```

### Cross-References
- **Implementation RFCs reference Architectural RFCs** using Notion mentions
- **Architectural RFCs link to Implementation RFCs** for execution guidance
- **Dependency tracking** between implementation tasks
- **Version alignment** between layers

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Structure Setup
1. Create "Implementation" subfolder in Notion RFC collection
2. Define implementation RFC template in Notion
3. Create cross-reference system between layers

### Phase 2: Content Creation
1. Transform RFC-001 as prototype implementation RFC
2. Validate format with existing automation scripts
3. Create implementation RFCs for core architecture (RFC-001 through RFC-004)

### Phase 3: Automation Integration
1. Modify `generate_micro_issues_from_rfc.py` for Notion API integration
2. Implement change detection and deduplication
3. Add quality validation for generated issues

### Phase 4: Workflow Validation
1. Test full automation flow with sample RFCs
2. Validate GitHub Copilot can execute generated issues
3. Measure issue completion success rate

## Success Metrics

- **Implementation RFC Coverage**: All architectural RFCs have corresponding implementation RFCs
- **Automation Success Rate**: >90% of implementation RFCs successfully generate issues
- **Issue Quality**: >85% of generated issues completed by GitHub Copilot without human intervention
- **Consistency**: All implementation RFCs follow standardized structure

## Dependencies

- Notion API integration (Flow-RFC-002)
- Content transformation rules (Flow-RFC-003)
- Change detection system (Flow-RFC-004)
- GitHub integration enhancements (Flow-RFC-005)

## Future Considerations

- **Automated transformation**: Generate implementation RFCs from architectural RFCs
- **Template system**: Standardized templates for different RFC types
- **Quality gates**: Automated validation of implementation RFC completeness
- **Metrics dashboard**: Track implementation progress and success rates
