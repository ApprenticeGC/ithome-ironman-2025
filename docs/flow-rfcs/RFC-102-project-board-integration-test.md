# RFC-102: Project Board Integration Test (Track: flow)

- Start Date: 2025-09-17
- RFC Author: Copilot
- Status: Draft
- Track: flow

## Summary

Create a comprehensive integration test for the repaired project board workflow to verify that it correctly adds project tracking comments to RFC issues and properly integrates with the GitHub Projects v2 automation pipeline.

## Motivation

The `update-project-board.yml` workflow has been recently repaired and needs validation to ensure it correctly:
- Detects RFC issues (title contains "RFC-")
- Adds project tracking comments to new RFC issues
- Integrates properly with the GitHub Projects automation pipeline
- Functions as expected in the automated RFC implementation flow

Without proper testing, we cannot be confident that the project board integration is working correctly and providing the intended visibility into RFC progress.

## Detailed Design

### Test Architecture

The integration test will validate the complete flow:

1. **Issue Creation**: Create an RFC-102-01 test issue
2. **Workflow Trigger**: Verify `update-project-board.yml` is triggered by issue creation
3. **RFC Detection**: Confirm workflow correctly identifies the issue as an RFC issue
4. **Comment Addition**: Validate that the workflow adds the expected project tracking comment
5. **Content Verification**: Ensure the comment contains the correct project board link and status information

### Test Components

- **Test RFC Issue**: RFC-102-01 will serve as the test case
- **Validation Script**: Script to create test issue and verify workflow execution
- **Expected Behavior**: Document expected workflow outputs and comment format
- **Cleanup Process**: Ensure test artifacts can be cleaned up after validation

### Integration Points

- GitHub Issues API (for issue creation and comment verification)
- GitHub Actions workflow triggers
- Project board automation rules
- Existing test infrastructure in the repository

## Alternatives Considered

- **Manual Testing**: Rejected as it's not repeatable and prone to human error
- **Unit Tests Only**: Rejected as they wouldn't test the actual workflow integration
- **Mock Testing**: Rejected as it wouldn't validate real GitHub API interactions

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk**: Test issues polluting the repository
- **Mitigation**: Use dedicated test issue numbers and automated cleanup
- **Risk**: Workflow conflicts with production automation
- **Mitigation**: Use test-specific issue titles and careful timing
