# RFC-099: Test Complete Diagnostic Workflow Automation

- Start Date: 2025-01-11
- RFC Author: Copilot
- Status: Draft
- Depends On: RFC-092
- Track: flow

## Summary

Test the complete end-to-end automation pipeline with comprehensive diagnostic workflow analysis and blocker detection throughout the automation process.

## Motivation

- Validate that diagnostic workflows provide visibility into automation blockers
- Ensure blocker analysis is posted at appropriate stages
- Test complete automation pipeline with diagnostic feedback loops
- Verify that diagnostics enable automated recovery and intervention

### Non-goals

- Creating new automation workflows (those already exist)
- Replacing existing diagnostic systems
- Adding unnecessary complexity to the workflow pipeline

## Detailed Design

The diagnostic workflow automation should provide:

1. **Issue Assignment Diagnostics**: Track and report issues with Copilot assignment
2. **PR Creation Diagnostics**: Monitor and analyze PR creation bottlenecks  
3. **CI Pipeline Diagnostics**: Enhanced validation with blocker detection
4. **Auto-merge Diagnostics**: Comprehensive analysis of merge blockers
5. **End-to-end Flow Diagnostics**: Complete pipeline health monitoring

### Architecture

```
Issue Creation → Assignment Diagnostics → PR Creation Diagnostics → CI Diagnostics → Merge Diagnostics
     ↓                ↓                        ↓                      ↓                ↓
Blocker Analysis → Blocker Analysis → Blocker Analysis → Blocker Analysis → Final Analysis
```

### Data Contracts

Diagnostic output should include:
- Timestamp of analysis
- Stage of automation pipeline
- Blocker status (none, warning, critical)
- Detailed analysis message
- Recommended actions

## Implementation Plan (Micro Issues)

### RFC-099-01: Test Complete Diagnostic Workflow Automation

Test the complete end-to-end automation pipeline with diagnostic workflow.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Issue triggers Copilot PR creation
- [ ] Diagnostic workflow posts blocker analysis
- [ ] Auto-review approves Copilot PR  
- [ ] CI automation works end-to-end
- [ ] PR merges automatically

**Success Metrics:**
Complete automation without manual intervention with diagnostic visibility throughout the process.

## Alternatives Considered

### Option A: Extend existing RFC-092 tests
- Pros: Minimal duplication, builds on existing work
- Cons: Doesn't specifically focus on diagnostic workflow validation

### Option B: Create entirely new diagnostic framework
- Pros: Clean slate, purpose-built diagnostics
- Cons: Too much overhead, duplicates existing functionality

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Diagnostic overhead slows automation
- Mitigation: Keep diagnostic analysis lightweight and async where possible

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete automation flow works without manual intervention
- [ ] Diagnostic analysis is posted at each critical stage
- [ ] Blockers are identified and reported with actionable information
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms can act on diagnostic feedback
- [ ] End-to-end diagnostic visibility is maintained
