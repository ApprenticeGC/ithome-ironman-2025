## Summary

- Ensured agent guidance and playbook references exist in-repo.

## Actions taken
1. Added `.gitignore` for OS/editor, Node/Python, .NET bin/obj, and build artifacts.
2. Added `.editorconfig` to enforce line endings and whitespace.
3. Wrote a concise `README.md` with overview, layout, and contributing guidance.
4. Enhanced `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` with clearer rules.
5. Tracked `docs/playbook/PLAYBOOK.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for referenced includes.
