# GitHub Projects (v2) Integration Guide

## üéØ Project Overview

GitHub Projects v2 provides kanban-style issue organization that perfectly complements our automation pipeline. The project board at [https://github.com/users/ApprenticeGC/projects/2/views/1](https://github.com/users/ApprenticeGC/projects/2/views/1) serves as a visual dashboard for RFC implementation progress.

## üìä Board Structure

### **Recommended Columns**:

1. **üìù RFC Backlog**
   - Purpose: New RFC issues awaiting implementation
   - Trigger: Issues created with "RFC-" prefix
   - Duration: Until Copilot picks up the work

2. **ü§ñ Copilot Working** 
   - Purpose: Issues currently being implemented
   - Trigger: When Copilot creates implementation PR
   - Duration: While PR is in development/CI

3. **üîÑ PR Review**
   - Purpose: PRs created and going through approval
   - Trigger: PR opened and ready for review
   - Duration: Until PR is merged/closed

4. **‚úÖ Complete**
   - Purpose: Successfully merged implementations
   - Trigger: PR merged successfully
   - Duration: Permanent archive

### **Custom Fields** (Recommended):

- **RFC Category**: `Architecture | Testing | Security | Infrastructure | UI`
- **Complexity**: `Low | Medium | High`
- **Auto-merge Status**: `Pending | Success | Failed | Manual`
- **Dependencies**: Text field for related RFCs

## üîÑ Automation Integration

### **Current Workflow Integration**:

The `.github/workflows/update-project-board.yml` workflow automatically:
- Detects RFC issues (title contains "RFC-")
- Adds project tracking comments to new RFC issues
- Logs PR status changes for future automation
- Tracks workflow completion events

### **Manual Setup Steps**:

1. **Create Project Columns**: Set up the 4 recommended columns in your project
2. **Add Custom Fields**: Configure the recommended custom fields
3. **Configure Automation**: Use GitHub's built-in project automation rules

### **GitHub Native Automation Rules** (Project Settings ‚Üí Workflows):

```yaml
# Auto-add issues to project
- name: "Auto-add RFC issues"
  trigger: "Issue opened"
  condition: "Title contains 'RFC-'"
  action: "Add to project in 'RFC Backlog' column"

# Move to working when PR created  
- name: "Move to Copilot Working"
  trigger: "PR linked to issue"
  condition: "PR author is 'github-copilot[bot]'"
  action: "Move issue to 'Copilot Working' column"

# Move to review when PR ready
- name: "Move to PR Review" 
  trigger: "PR ready for review"
  condition: "PR is linked to project issue"
  action: "Move issue to 'PR Review' column"

# Move to complete when merged
- name: "Move to Complete"
  trigger: "PR merged"  
  condition: "PR is linked to project issue"
  action: "Move issue to 'Complete' column"
```

## üìà Benefits for RFC Development

### **Visibility**:
- **Progress Tracking**: See all RFCs at a glance
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Spot issues stuck in review
- **Completion Rate**: Track automation success rate

### **Organization**:
- **Priority Management**: Drag important RFCs to top
- **Dependency Tracking**: Link related implementations  
- **Category Grouping**: Filter by RFC type

### **Metrics**:
- **Cycle Time**: How long from issue to completion
- **Success Rate**: % of RFCs successfully auto-merged
- **Active Work**: How many RFCs Copilot is handling

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Configuration Tips

### **Views to Create**:

1. **Board View** (Default): Kanban columns for workflow
2. **Table View**: All RFCs with status, complexity, dates
3. **Roadmap View**: Timeline of RFC implementations
4. **Archive View**: Completed RFCs for reference

### **Filters**:
- **Active RFCs**: Status not "Complete"
- **High Priority**: Complexity is "High" 
- **Failed Automation**: Auto-merge status is "Failed"
- **Recent Activity**: Updated in last 7 days

### **Grouping Options**:
- **By Status**: See workflow distribution
- **By Category**: Group related RFCs together
- **By Complexity**: Prioritize by effort required

## üéØ Best Practices

### **Issue Creation**:
- Always use "RFC-XXX" prefix for automatic detection
- Add appropriate labels for filtering
- Link related issues in description

### **Project Maintenance**:
- Review board weekly for stuck items
- Update custom fields when status changes
- Archive completed items monthly

### **Integration Monitoring**:
- Check workflow logs for automation issues
- Verify project updates match actual PR status
- Update automation rules as workflow evolves

## üîó Integration with Existing Automation

The project board **enhances** rather than replaces our automation:
- **Issues still trigger** the Direct Merge PR workflow
- **PRs still auto-merge** according to existing rules
- **Project board provides** visual tracking layer
- **Automation logs remain** the source of truth

This creates a **dual benefit**:
- **Developers** get visual project management
- **Automation** continues running seamlessly in background
- **Progress tracking** becomes effortless and comprehensive

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Configure Project**: Set up columns and fields as recommended
2. **Test Integration**: Create a test RFC issue to verify automation  
3. **Tune Workflows**: Adjust project automation rules based on usage
4. **Monitor & Iterate**: Track effectiveness and refine as needed

*This integration leverages GitHub Projects v2 as a powerful visualization layer on top of our existing automation pipeline, providing the best of both worlds: automated RFC implementation with comprehensive progress tracking.*
