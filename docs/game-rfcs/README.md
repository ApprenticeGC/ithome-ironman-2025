# Game RFCs

This folder contains the canonical Game RFCs for the generic game/editor (TUI-first) and engine simulation via profiles.

Guidelines
- Keep RFCs here as the single source of truth.
- Break into micro issues only when creating GitHub issues (do not add micro files).
- Use `../rfc-templates/RFC-TEMPLATE.md` to author new RFCs.
