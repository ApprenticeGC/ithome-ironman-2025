# RFC-998: Normal Flow Test

## Status
- **RFC ID**: 998
- **Title**: Normal Flow Test
- **Status**: Active
- **Author**: Claude Code Testing Framework
- **Created**: 2025-09-16

## Summary

This RFC serves as a test case for validating the complete normal workflow path:
Issue Creation → Assignment → PR Creation → CI Success → Ready → Merge → Issue Close

## Test Objectives

1. Validate automatic issue generation from RFC
2. Verify Copilot assignment works correctly
3. Confirm PR creation happens automatically after assignment
4. Test CI pipeline execution and success detection
5. Verify draft→ready transition on CI success
6. Confirm auto-merge functionality
7. Validate issue closure after PR merge

## Test Micro Issues

### RFC-998-01: Initialize test placeholder
- Create a simple placeholder file to validate basic workflow
- Expected: Issue created → Copilot assigned → PR created → CI passes → Merged → Issue closed

### RFC-998-02: Add test content (if needed)
- Add minimal test content to validate content handling
- This micro will only be created if RFC-998-01 completes successfully

## Implementation Notes

This RFC is specifically designed for testing the workflow automation.
The implementation should be minimal to focus on workflow validation rather than functional complexity.

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Issues created automatically from RFC
- ✅ Only one issue assigned to Copilot at a time
- ✅ PR created automatically after assignment
- ✅ CI pipeline executes successfully
- ✅ PR transitions from draft to ready after CI success
- ✅ Auto-merge completes successfully
- ✅ Linked issue closes automatically after merge

## Cleanup

After successful test completion, this RFC and associated artifacts should be cleaned up to maintain repository hygiene.
