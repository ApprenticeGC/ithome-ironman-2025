# RFC-012: Deployment Pipeline Automation (Track: game)

- Start Date: 2024-09-22
- RFC Author: GitHub Copilot
- Status: Draft
- Track: game

## Summary

Create automated deployment pipeline for the GameConsole application to enable continuous deployment to staging and production environments, building upon the existing comprehensive CI/CD automation infrastructure.

## Motivation

The repository has a sophisticated automation pipeline for issue management, PR processing, and CI/CD testing, but lacks deployment automation. Currently:

- Build and test automation is fully operational
- PR merge automation works end-to-end
- No automated deployment to target environments exists
- Manual deployment processes create bottlenecks and potential for errors

**Goals:**
- Automate deployment of GameConsole application to staging and production
- Integrate deployment pipeline with existing automation workflows
- Ensure deployments are triggered automatically after successful PR merges
- Support rollback capabilities for failed deployments

**Non-goals:**
- Changing existing CI/CD automation (it's working well)
- Complex multi-region deployment strategies
- Database migration automation (not applicable for this project)

## Detailed Design

### Architecture

The deployment pipeline will extend the existing automation with:

```
Existing Flow: Issue → PR → CI/Test → Merge
New Flow:      Issue → PR → CI/Test → Merge → Deploy Staging → Deploy Production
```

### Components

#### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows
- `deploy-staging.yml`: Automated staging deployment after merge to main
- `deploy-production.yml`: Manual/tagged production deployment
- `rollback-deployment.yml`: Rollback capability for failed deployments

#### 2. Deployment Scripts
- `scripts/deployment/deploy.sh`: Core deployment script
- `scripts/deployment/health-check.sh`: Post-deployment validation
- `scripts/deployment/rollback.sh`: Rollback automation

#### 3. Environment Configuration
- Staging and production environment variables
- Deployment target configurations
- Health check endpoints

### Data Contracts / Public APIs

No new public APIs required. The deployment pipeline will:
- Build the GameConsole application using existing dotnet tooling
- Package artifacts for deployment
- Deploy to target environments
- Validate deployment health

### Profiles/Capabilities

The GameConsole application supports multiple profiles through its tier-based architecture:
- TUI profile for console environments
- Different provider configurations for staging vs production
- Environment-specific capability configurations

### Failure/Recovery

- Health checks after each deployment
- Automatic rollback on deployment failures
- Notification integration with existing automation
- Deployment status reporting

## Alternatives Considered

### Option A: Docker-based Deployment
**Pros:** Consistent environments, easy rollbacks
**Cons:** Adds complexity, requires container infrastructure

### Option B: Direct Binary Deployment  
**Pros:** Simple, leverages existing dotnet build process
**Cons:** Environment consistency challenges

**Selected:** Option B with enhanced environment validation

### Option C: Third-party Deployment Tools
**Pros:** Feature-rich deployment capabilities
**Cons:** Dependencies on external tools, breaks automation simplicity

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1:** Deployment failures break the automation chain
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive health checks and automatic rollback

**Risk 2:** Environment configuration drift
**Mitigation:** Configuration as code with validation

**Risk 3:** Secrets management in deployment
**Mitigation:** GitHub Secrets with environment-specific access
