# RFC-012: Deployment Pipeline Automation (Track: game)

- Start Date: 2025-09-22
- RFC Author: GitHub Copilot
- Status: Draft
- Depends On: Existing CI pipeline (ci.yml)
- Track: game

## Summary

Implement automated deployment pipeline to support continuous delivery of GameConsole applications to staging and production environments, building on the existing CI infrastructure to provide seamless release automation.

## Motivation

### Problem Statement and Goals

- **Problem**: Currently, the repository has only CI (build/test) but no automated deployment pipeline
- **Goal 1**: Automate deployment of GameConsole applications after successful CI
- **Goal 2**: Support multiple deployment environments (staging, production)  
- **Goal 3**: Enable rollback capabilities for failed deployments
- **Goal 4**: Maintain quality gates (build warnings as errors, all tests must pass)

### Non-goals

- Modifying existing CI pipeline behavior
- Adding new build/test requirements beyond existing standards
- Infrastructure provisioning (assumes deployment targets exist)

## Detailed Design

### Architecture

The deployment pipeline will extend the existing CI workflow with:

```
CI Pipeline (existing)     →    Deployment Pipeline (new)
├── Build & Test           →    ├── Package Applications
├── Quality Gates          →    ├── Deploy to Staging
└── Merge Success          →    ├── Health Checks
                                ├── Deploy to Production
                                └── Rollback on Failure
```

### Data Contracts / Public APIs

Deployment workflow will expose:
- Environment-specific deployment status
- Rollback triggers via workflow dispatch
- Deployment health check endpoints

### Profiles/Capabilities

- **Staging Profile**: Fast deployment for testing
- **Production Profile**: Blue-green deployment with health checks
- **Rollback Capability**: Automated rollback on health check failure

### Failure/Recovery

- Failed health checks trigger automatic rollback
- Manual rollback available via workflow dispatch
- Deployment status tracked in GitHub environments

## Alternatives Considered

### Option A: Docker-based Deployment (Preferred)
- **Pros**: Consistent environments, easy rollbacks, portable
- **Cons**: Requires Docker knowledge, container overhead

### Option B: Direct Binary Deployment  
- **Pros**: Simple, fast, no containerization overhead
- **Cons**: Environment consistency issues, harder rollbacks

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk 1**: Deployment failures in production
  - **Mitigation**: Staged deployment with health checks and automatic rollback

- **Risk 2**: Breaking existing CI workflow
  - **Mitigation**: Deploy pipeline runs independently after CI success

## Implementation Plan (Micro Issues)

When creating GitHub issues, break this RFC into micro tasks `RFC-012-YY` with clear acceptance criteria to drive Copilot. Do not add micro RFC files to source control.
