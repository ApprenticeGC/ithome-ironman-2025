# Workflow Reset - September 16, 2025

## Issue
PR #88 was still showing as successful despite implementing enhanced CI validation, indicating the problematic automation chain was still active.

## Actions Taken

### Disabled Workflows
The following workflows have been temporarily disabled to break the false-success cycle:

1. **auto-ready-pr.yml** → `auto-ready-pr.yml.disabled`
   - Was automatically marking draft PRs as ready based on shallow CI success
   - Now enhanced with log validation but needs testing

2. **auto-approve-merge.yml** → `auto-approve-merge.yml.disabled`
   - Automatically approves and enables auto-merge for Copilot PRs
   - Bypasses manual review process

3. **auto-advance-micro.yml** → `auto-advance-micro.yml.disabled`
   - Part of the micro-issue advancement chain
   - Could interfere with proper validation

### Enhanced CI Validation Still Active
- `scripts/python/production/validate_ci_logs.py` - Log analysis system
- Enhanced `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with better error handling
- All improvements remain in place

## Current State

✅ **Immediate Benefits**:
- PRs will no longer auto-advance without manual review
- False CI successes will not trigger automatic approvals
- Manual control restored over the PR process

⚠️ **Manual Process Required**:
- Draft PRs must be manually marked ready
- PRs require manual approval before merge
- More oversight but safer workflow

## Re-enabling Process

When ready to test the enhanced validation:

1. **Test Phase**: Re-enable only `auto-ready-pr.yml` first
   ```bash
   mv .github/workflows/auto-ready-pr.yml.disabled .github/workflows/auto-ready-pr.yml
   ```

2. **Validation Phase**: Create a test PR with intentional warnings to verify blocking works

3. **Full Restoration**: If validation works correctly, use the re-enable script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/re-enable-automation.sh
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Monitor PR #88 and future PRs for proper behavior
2. Test the enhanced CI validation in a controlled manner
3. Gradually re-enable automation once validation is confirmed working
4. Update RFC-091 with test results

## Files Changed
- `.github/workflows/auto-ready-pr.yml` → disabled
- `.github/workflows/auto-approve-merge.yml` → disabled
- `.github/workflows/auto-advance-micro.yml` → disabled
- `scripts/re-enable-automation.sh` → created for easy restoration
