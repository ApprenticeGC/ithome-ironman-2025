# GameConsole AI Local Deployment Infrastructure

This document summarizes the implementation of RFC-008-01: Create Local AI Deployment Infrastructure.

## Overview

The `GameConsole.AI.Local` project provides a comprehensive local AI deployment infrastructure with resource management and optimization capabilities. It implements all the required components specified in the RFC while following the existing 4-tier architecture patterns.

## Core Components

### 1. ILocalAIRuntime (Main Orchestrator)
- **Purpose**: Main service interface that orchestrates all local AI operations
- **Key Features**:
  - Runtime configuration and lifecycle management
  - Inference execution with automatic resource management
  - Performance monitoring and optimization
  - Support for multiple AI frameworks (ONNX Runtime)
  - Automatic model loading and management

### 2. IAIResourceManager (Resource Allocation)
- **Purpose**: Manages GPU/CPU allocation and optimization
- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic resource allocation with priority support
  - Resource usage monitoring and statistics
  - Automatic optimization and cleanup
  - Resource limits enforcement
  - Fallback mechanisms for resource constraints
  - Multi-platform execution provider support (CPU, CUDA, DirectML, CoreML)

### 3. IModelCacheManager (Model Storage)
- **Purpose**: Handles efficient local model storage and retrieval
- **Key Features**:
  - File-based model caching with compression
  - Multiple eviction policies (LRU, LFU, FIFO, Largest First)
  - Cache statistics and maintenance
  - Model integrity verification with checksums
  - Automatic cleanup and optimization

### 4. ILocalInferenceEngine (Model Execution)
- **Purpose**: Executes AI models with batching and scheduling
- **Key Features**:
  - ONNX Runtime integration for cross-platform inference
  - Dynamic batching for throughput optimization
  - Model quantization support
  - Performance metrics tracking
  - Memory management for large models
  - Async execution with cancellation support

## Key Technical Features

### Cross-Platform Inference
- Uses ONNX Runtime as the primary inference framework
- Supports multiple execution providers (CPU, CUDA, DirectML, CoreML, OpenVINO)
- Automatic fallback to CPU when specialized providers are unavailable

### Dynamic Batching
- Configurable batch sizes and timeouts
- Automatic request batching for improved throughput
- Priority-based request scheduling

### Model Quantization
- Support for Dynamic, Static, and Mixed Precision quantization
- Configurable quantization modes for performance optimization
- Memory usage reduction for large models

### Resource Management
- GPU and CPU resource monitoring
- Memory limit enforcement
- Automatic resource cleanup and optimization
- Emergency thresholds for system protection

### Performance Monitoring
- Detailed inference metrics (latency, throughput, success rates)
- Resource usage statistics
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Historical performance tracking

## Configuration

The system is highly configurable through several configuration classes:

### LocalAIConfiguration
```csharp
var config = new LocalAIConfiguration
{
    EnableAutoOptimization = true,
    MaxConcurrentInferences = 4,
    DefaultTimeoutSeconds = 30,
    Resources = new ResourceConfiguration(),
    ModelCache = new ModelCacheConfiguration(),
    Inference = new InferenceConfiguration(),
    Performance = new PerformanceConfiguration()
};
```

### Resource Configuration
- Maximum GPU/CPU usage limits
- Preferred execution providers
- Resource allocation strategies (Balanced, Performance, MemoryEfficient, Conservative)

### Cache Configuration
- Cache directory and size limits
- Compression settings
- Eviction policies and cleanup intervals

### Inference Configuration
- Batch sizes and timeouts
- Quantization settings
- Dynamic batching options

## Integration with Existing Architecture

The implementation follows the established patterns in the repository:

### IService Interface Pattern
- All main components implement the `IService` interface from `GameConsole.Core.Abstractions`
- Consistent async lifecycle management (Initialize, Start, Stop)
- Proper resource disposal patterns

### 4-Tier Architecture Compliance
- **Tier 1**: Core interfaces and contracts (ILocalAIRuntime, etc.)
- **Tier 2**: Service implementations with business logic
- **Tier 3**: Configuration and resource management
- **Tier 4**: Provider implementations (ONNX Runtime integration)

### Dependency Injection Ready
- Constructor injection patterns
- Interface-based dependencies
- Compatible with existing service registry patterns

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests covering:
- Component creation and initialization
- Resource management operations
- Model caching functionality
- Inference engine capabilities
- Integration between components

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

✅ **Local AI runtime supports multiple frameworks**

- Dynamic allocation, monitoring, and optimization

✅ **Model cache provides efficient storage and retrieval**
- File-based caching with compression and intelligent eviction

✅ **Inference engine handles batching and scheduling**
- Dynamic batching with configurable parameters

✅ **Performance monitoring and optimization**
- Comprehensive metrics and automatic optimization

✅ **Memory management for large models**
- Resource limits, cleanup, and optimization strategies

✅ **Fallback mechanisms for resource constraints**
- Graceful degradation and error handling

## Dependencies

- **Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime** (1.18.0): Cross-platform AI inference
- **Microsoft.Extensions.Logging** (8.0.1): Structured logging
- **System.Text.Json** (8.0.5): Configuration serialization
- **System.Numerics.Tensors** (8.0.0): Tensor operations

## Future Extensibility

The architecture is designed to be extensible for future AI agent framework integration:

- Interface-based design allows for easy provider swapping
- Configuration system supports framework-specific settings
- Resource management scales to support multiple AI workloads
- Model cache can handle various model formats

## Usage Example

```csharp
// Create and configure the runtime
var logger = serviceProvider.GetService<ILogger<LocalAIRuntime>>();
var resourceManager = new AIResourceManager(resourceLogger);
var cacheManager = new ModelCacheManager(cacheLogger);
var inferenceEngine = new LocalInferenceEngine(inferenceLogger);

var runtime = new LocalAIRuntime(logger, resourceManager, cacheManager, inferenceEngine);

// Configure and start
var config = new LocalAIConfiguration();
await runtime.ConfigureRuntimeAsync(config);
await runtime.InitializeAsync();
await runtime.StartAsync();

// Execute inference
var request = new AIInferenceRequest
{
    ModelId = "my-model",
    InputData = new Dictionary<string, object> { ["input"] = new float[] { 1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f } }
};

var result = await runtime.ExecuteInferenceAsync(request);
```

This implementation provides a solid foundation for local AI deployment that can be extended to support the future AI agent framework requirements mentioned in the dependencies (RFC-007-01 and RFC-007-02).
